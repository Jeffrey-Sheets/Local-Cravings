## 1 Introduction

Everyone has cravings when they are hungry. But when you're on vacation you don't want a large corporate chain that you've been to a thousand times, that's where **Local Cravings** comes in. This app gathers all the local restaurants in your area and shows them to you. You can filter out restraunts based on their star rating, what food they offer, and other aspects that may dictate where you'll go.

## 2 Architectural Design

**Local Cravings** will be primarily programmed in Kotlin. While we will also utilize googles placeID API to aquire the information on restraunts in a certain area. For the server side the app will use Firebase to store information like the profiles of the users and which restaurants they have favorited.
